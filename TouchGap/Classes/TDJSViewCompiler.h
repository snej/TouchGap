/** A view compiler for TouchDB that compiles and runs traditional JavaScript map/reduce functions.
    Requires the JavaScriptCore framework; this is a public system framework on Mac OS but private
    on iOS; so on the latter platform you'll need to link your app with your own copy of
    JavaScriptCore. See <https://github.com/phoboslab/JavaScriptCore-iOS>. */
